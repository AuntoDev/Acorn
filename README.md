# NOT FINISHED YET

## Hacks blocked
What hacks does Acorn block? Good question. Here's a list, Acorn may block more:
- Fly:
  - Glide
  - 3D
  - Vanilla/Creative
  - GroundSpoof
  - Mineplex/AAC bypass
  - BoatFly*
- Speed:
  - Speed limits
  - Impossible speeds
  - Change in speed*
  - Entity speed*
- Jesus
- Invalid moves

Remember, Acorn will *probably* block hacks not listed here. Any hacks marked with a * are pending a check (will be added soon).

## How are patches processed?
**Urgent patches are issued as a security advisory.** Any other patches or bug fixes are either dealt with via pull-requests and issues, or release updates.

## I would like to report an issue
Please make an issue under the "Issues" tab.

## Can I contribute?
