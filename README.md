What hacks does Acorn block? Good question. Here's a list, Acorn may block more:
- Fly:
  - Glide
  - 3D
  - Vanilla/Creative

  - BoatFly*
- Speed:
  - BHop
  - VHop

## ProtocolLib
ProtocolLib is an Acorn **dependency**. Acorn requires it to function.

## How are patches processed?
**Urgent patches are issued as a security advisory.** Any other patches or bug fixes are either dealt with via pull-requests and issues, or release updates.
